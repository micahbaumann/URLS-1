# Guides - Install
1. Download and open the `urls_welcome.php` file in your browser.
2. Enter a base url. The base url is the path from your servers public directory (usally `public_html` or `htdocs`) to where you want the framework to be installed. It should begin and end in a `/`. If the base directory is the root of the public directory, then enter one `/`. For example, if your public directory is `htdocs` and you want to install the framework at `/htdocs/blog/` then you should enter in `/htdocs/blog/`.
4. Start makeking your urls! For a more complete example see guides/INSTALL.md.
